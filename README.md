The applied & screened in-house libraries are confidential, and they will be updated with following experiments. 
The technical details & logic of the developed model are described in uploaded files. 

For ML, we recommend sampling for benchmaring for users' screening tasks, especially under the situation that the ratio of active compounds is low. For specific drug-screening applications of our GCN&ML approach, users can select ML component by their own benchmarking.
